            Join us in exploring how agentic AI tutors enable adaptive and personalized learning in real-world education systems
        </h3>

        <p class="abstract-text text-align-justify">
            Recent advances in large language and multimodal models have enabled agentic AI tutors to operate autonomously in real-world 
            education systems. This keynote presents how adaptive and personalized educational AI agents are designed and deployed at scale 
            using state-of-the-art techniques, including multi-agent LLM reasoning, multimodal error analysis, dialog-driven interaction, and 
            longitudinal learner modeling. Drawing on large-scale applications from Squirrel Ai Learning, the talk demonstrates how these AI 
            tutors perform fine-grained misconception diagnosis, personalized feedback generation, and adaptive learning path optimization 
            through continuous interaction with real student data. Validated through large-scale real-world deployments, this work highlights 
            key technical lessons on reliability, robustness, and trust in smart education ecosystems.
