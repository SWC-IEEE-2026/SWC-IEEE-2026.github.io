          Join us in exploring how intelligent edge sensing and distributed
          cognition are transforming smart worlds
        </h3>
        <p class="fs-5">
          Intelligent edge sensing and distributed cognition are reshaping the
          architecture of future smart worlds. By enabling real-time perception,
          processing, and decision-making at the network edge, intelligent
          sensing technologies reduce latency, enhance privacy, and support
          context-aware adaptation. At the same time, distributed cognition,
          defined as the integration of sensing, learning, memory, and reasoning
          across decentralized systems, provides a powerful framework for
          creating scalable and resilient intelligent environments. This talk
          will explore key advances in edge sensing frameworks, lightweight AI
          models, and associative memory mechanisms that are driving this
          transformation. Real-world applications in intelligent city
          transportation, elderly healthcare, and sparse mobile crowdsensing
          will be presented, highlighting how intelligent edge sensing and
          distributed cognition enable more responsive, efficient, and
          human-centric systems. Finally, future directions toward
          energy-efficient cognitive ecosystems and ethical considerations in
          distributed intelligence will also be discussed.

        <h4>Biography</h4>
        <p>
          Runhe Huang received her B.Sc. in Electronics Technology from the
          National University of Defense Technology, China, in 1982, and her
          Ph.D. in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of the
          West of England, UK, in 1993. She is a full professor in the Faculty
          of Computer and Information Sciences at Hosei University, Japan, where
          she has held the position since 2003. She served as the head of the
          Department of Computer Science from 2008 to 2010 and currently holds
          the position of Deputy Director at Hosei University Library. She is a
          senior member of IEEE and ACM, and served as the IEEE CIS SWTC chair
          and vice chair from 2019 to 2022. Her research fields include
          Artificial Intelligence, Ubiquitous Intelligence Computing, Machine
          Intelligence, Cognitive Computing, and Knowledge Modeling. She has
          authored more than 200 academic papers.
