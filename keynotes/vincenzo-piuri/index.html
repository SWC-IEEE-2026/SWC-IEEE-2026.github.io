            Join us in exploring how artificial intelligence enables adaptive, autonomous cloud-fog-edge and IoT
            applications and infrastructures.
        </h3>

        <p class="abstract-text text-align-justify">
            Recent years have seen a growing interest among users in the migration of their
            applications to the Cloud/Fog/Edge computing and Internet-of-Things environments.
            However, due to high complexity, Cloud/Fog/Edge-based and Internet-of-Things
            infrastructures need advanced components for supporting applications and advanced
            management techniques for increasing the efficiency.
            Adaptivity and autonomous learning abilities become extremely useful to support
            configuration and dynamic adaptation of these infrastructures to the changing needs of
            the users as well as to create adaptable applications. This self-adaptation ability is
            increasingly essential especially for non-expert managers as well as for application
            designers and developers with limited competences in tools for achieving this ability.
            Artificial intelligence is a set of techniques which greatly can improve both the creation
            of applications and the management of these infrastructures.
            This talk will discuss the use of artificial intelligence in supporting the creation of
            applications in cloud/fog/edge and IoT infrastructures as well as their use in the various
            aspects of infrastructure management.
