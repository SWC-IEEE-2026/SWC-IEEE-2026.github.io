            Join us in exploring the hidden potential and added value of Physical Intelligence on the Edge.
        </h3>

        <p class="abstract-text text-align-justify">
            Physical Intelligence on the Edge (PIE) is an emerging paradigm in which raw sensor
            streams are transformed into real-time, safety-critical intelligence that can act in the physical
            world. This talk traces the evolution from centralized to distributed and edge architectures and
            argues that PIE marks a qualitative shift: the edge becomes the primary platform for tightly
            integrating sensing, reasoning, and actuation under stringent real-time constraints. Dr. Shi will
            introduce five research thrusts—embodied spatial reasoning, embodied temporal reasoning,
            edge-native customization, symbiosis, and sustainability—and use a hypothetical PIE scenario
            to highlight a core gap in today’s systems: while current edge platforms can run components of
            perception and inference, they still cannot autonomously close the sense-think-act loop with
            certifiable guarantees on timing and safety. Finally, he will talk about the recent development
            of D-STAR, a live and evolving testbed for vehicle computing on the STAR campus at the
            University of Delaware.

                    is an Alumni Distinguished Professor and Department Chair of Computer and Information Sciences at the University 
                    of Delaware (UD). He leads the Connected and Autonomous Research (CAR) Laboratory. Dr. Shi is the Honorary Center 
                    Director of a recently funded NSF eCAT Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) (2023-2028), 
                    focusing on Electric, Connected, and Autonomous Technology for Mobility. He is an internationally renowned expert 
                    in edge computing, autonomous driving, and connected health. His pioneer paper, “Edge Computing: Vision and 
                    Challenges,” has been cited over 10k times. He is the Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Internet Computing Magazine and 
                    the founding steering committee chair of several conferences, including the ACM/IEEE Symposium on Edge
                    Computing (SEC), IEEE/ACM International Conference on Connected Health (CHASE), and IEEE
                    International Conference on Mobility (MOST). He is a fellow of IEEE and a member of CRA’s
                    Computing Community Consortium (CCC) Council.
