            Join us in exploring how Large Language Models and Big Data are
            redefining the future of scientific discovery
        </h3>

        <p class="abstract-text text-align-justify">
            The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the explosion of big data are redefining how we
            discover knowledge. This talk explores the powerful convergence of big data analytics and LLM
            intelligence, highlighting how LLMs can act as scientific co-pilots to help with data processing,
            hypothesis generation, code automation, experimental documentation, and cross-disciplinary
            knowledge integration. By addressing limitations such as hallucination, energy cost, and domain
            adaptation, we look toward a future where human expertise and machine reasoning collaborate at
            scale. This synergy opens a new era of Big Science, enabling transparent, reproducible, and more
            creative discovery across scientific domains.
