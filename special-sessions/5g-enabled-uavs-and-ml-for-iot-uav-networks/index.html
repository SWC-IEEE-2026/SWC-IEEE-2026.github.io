          <p class="fs-5">
            The rapid advancement and commercialization of 5G technologies is
            unlocking new possibilities—and posing new challenges—for leveraging
            5G and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and
            machine learning (AI/ML). For defence, security, and smart city
            applications, the ability to achieve high situational awareness and
            respond quickly to dynamic threats is essential. Integrating novel
            sensing and processing techniques on UAVs and edge devices, paired
            with the low latency and high reliability of 5G, offers promising
            solutions to meet these critical needs. Modernizing data analytics
            systems with edge computing, software-defined networking (SDN), and
            intelligent resource allocation is also accelerating the development
            of innovative applications across today’s IoT/sensing landscape.
            <br /><br />
            This special session brings together researchers and practitioners
            to explore the latest advances at the intersection of 5G, AI/ML,
            IoT, and UAV systems (5G-ML-IoT-UAV).
