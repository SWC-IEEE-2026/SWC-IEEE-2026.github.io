        AI and Machine Learning: Transforming Data Analytics for Global Impact
        on Sustainability, Healthcare, and a Resilient Future
      </h2>
      <p class="fs-5">
        In an era defined by unprecedented data volumes and complex global
        challenges, this session aims to explore the transformative role of
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in redefining
        data analytics across critical domains such as healthcare,
        sustainability, and intelligent systems. As AI and ML technologies
        mature, this session offers a crucial platform to address urgent
        real-world problems and shape innovative solutions that drive global
        resilience and progress. Participants will engage in discussions about
        advancements that enhance data-driven decision-making, intelligent
        computing, and smart communication systems, fostering cross-disciplinary
        collaboration. The session will serve as a nexus for researchers,
        practitioners, and thought leaders to share cutting-edge methods,
        applications, and visionary directions in AI and data analytics with
        global impact.

        Special session on 5G-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and machine
        learning for IoT/UAV networks
      </h2>
      <p class="fs-5">
        The rapid advancement and commercialization of 5G technologies is
        unlocking new possibilities—and posing new challenges—for leveraging 5G
        and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine
        learning (AI/ML). For defense, security, and smart city applications,
        the ability to achieve high situational awareness and respond quickly to
        dynamic threats is essential. Integrating novel sensing and processing
        techniques on UAVs and edge devices, paired with the low latency and
        high reliability of 5G, offers promising solutions to meet these
        critical needs. Modernizing data analytics systems with edge computing,
        software-defined networking (SDN), and intelligent resource allocation
        is also accelerating the development of innovative applications across
        today’s IoT/sensing landscape.
