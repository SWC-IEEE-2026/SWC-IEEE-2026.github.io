          Join us in exploring how AI-driven technologies can transform the
          detection, monitoring, and support of mental health in an increasingly
          complex world
        </h3>
        <p class="fs-5">
          Mental health ailments encompass a wide spectrum of conditions that
          influence mood, cognition, and behavior, with depression emerging as
          one of the most prevalent global challenges in both developed and
          developing nations. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this
          crisis, leading to widespread emotional distress, job loss, and
          uncertainty about the future. As a result, depression has surged
          across all age groups, demanding scalable, empathetic, and data-driven
          interventions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) through machine learning,
          natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLM), deep
          learning, and Generative AI offers promising avenues for detecting,
          monitoring, and mitigating the effects of mental stress and
          depression. Coupled with computer vision, deep learning models can
          infer emotional states from facial expressions, postures, and
          behavioral cues, while machine learning algorithms can leverage
          behavioral histories to generate adaptive, supportive interventions.
          This tutorial presents a framework that combines responsible AI,
          digital twin technology, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to deliver
          ethical, interpretable, and human-centric healthcare solutions,
          particularly focused on mental health.

        <h4>Tutorial Overview</h4>
        <p>
          This tutorial explores the convergence of AI, IoT, and responsible
          design in healthcare, providing participants with technical
          foundations, applied methods, and real-world insights. It is
          structured into three core modules:
        </p>
        <h5>
          Module 1: Ubiquitous Healthcare via AI-Powered Internet of Things
        </h5>
        <p>
          Participants will explore how ubiquitous IoT systems comprising
          wearables, smart home devices, and ambient sensors enable continuous,
          location-independent patient monitoring. This module covers
          architectural design, data integration strategies, and
          interoperability standards essential for building scalable and secure
          health monitoring infrastructures.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Module 2: Predictive Models Utilizing Artificial Intelligence in
          Healthcare
        </h5>
        <p>
          This module addresses how physiological and behavioral signals
          collected from IoT devices can be transformed into actionable insights
          using AI. Topics include predictive modeling for physical and mental
          health, explainable AI (XAI) for transparency, and fairness-aware
          techniques to ensure inclusive healthcare. Practical examples,
          including emotion recognition and behavioral pattern analysis, will be
          demonstrated.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Module 3: Responsible Artificial Intelligence in Mental Healthcare
          Systems
        </h5>
        <p>
          Focusing on mental health, this module presents responsible AI
          methodologies that support the monitoring and management of conditions
          like depression and anxiety. Discussions will cover bias mitigation,
          privacy preservation, human-in-the-loop models, and ethical design
          principles. Real-world applications such as keystroke biomarker
          systems for Parkinson’s and mood prediction engines will be examined
          to illustrate responsible AI in action.
        </p>
        <h4>Audience Outcome:</h4>
        <p>By the end of the tutorial, participants will:</p>
        <ul>
